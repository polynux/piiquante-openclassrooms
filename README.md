# Piiquante

## Prerequisites

You need to have installed NodeJS and npm.

I personally use [pnpm](https://pnpm.io) for managing dependencies, but you could use npm or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) instead.

## Installation

To install the server, run the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/polynux/piiquante-openclassrooms.git
cd piiquante-openclassrooms
npm install
```

## Usage

To run the server in developpement mode, run the following command:

```bash
npm dev
```

To run the server in production mode, run the following command:

```bash
npm start
```

## Frontend

To run the frontend, run the following command:

```bash
npm run front
```

Keep in mind that this is only for testing purpose and not production ready.
